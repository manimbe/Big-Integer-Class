# Big Integer Class
## Overview
This repository is a C++ class for dealing with Big Integers (Bignteger), and licensed under [MIT License](https://github.com/manimbe/Big-Integer-Class/blob/main/LICENSE).

Originally this class was thought to solve the problems from the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) that requires the implementation of big integers.
